            <h3 id="pour-title">P.O.U.R - Principles</h3>
            <p id="pour">There are 4 different principles for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, these are:</p>
            <p id="perceive"><b>Perceivable:</b> All information and the interface must be properly presented to the users in a way that
                is easily perceivable. Some key elements include:</p>
            <p id="perceive-ex"> <mark>Alternate Text:</mark> This gives descriptions for images, graphics, controls, and other parts of the site
                <br><br> <mark>Adaptable Content:</mark> This is when the site can be presented properly on various different
                screen sizes without changing any content. <br><br> <mark>Distinguishable Content:</mark> This means that all information and 
                items on the screen must be easily distinguishable from each other by every users, including those with colour
                blindness and poor vision. <br><br> <mark>Content Structure:</mark> With this, you must ensure that proper HTML is used to 
                show good hierarchy and structure in your site. <br><br> <mark>Captions/Transcripts:</mark> These must be used to
                ensure that users who are dead or hard of hearing can understand what may be happening in video content on your site.
            </p>
            <br><br><br>
            <p id="operable"><b>Operable:</b> Users should be able to easily navigate your site using various methods, for example using a keyboard.
                There also should be no limit to the time the user can spend reading text / viewing images on the site, and it should be safe for
                those with epilepsy or for those who are sensitive to flashing lights to use. Some key elements include:
            </p>
            <p id="operable-ex"> <mark>Keyboard Accessibility:</mark> The user should be able to navigate and use the site with a keyboard, there should
                not be a requirement to use a mouse. This is especially important for those with lower mobility. <br><br> <mark>Input Assistance:</mark>
                There should be clear labelling to show the user what to do when inputting data, and there should be clear error messages that are easily
                to understand to prevent any confusion. <br><br> <mark>Focus on current items:</mark> It should be clearly obvious to the user which item/page/etc. that they are
                on, this can be done by changing the colour, or by making the fonts bigger. <br><br> <mark>Physical Reactions:</mark> The user should not have to
                worry about having physical reactions while using the site, this can be caused by flashing lights or fast/harsh flickering lights.
            </p>
            <p id="understandable"><b>Understandable:</b> The information in the user interface and the operation of it(way the user interacts with it)
                must be easily understandable to the user. The content must be consistent, readable, and have clear instructions. Some key elements include:
            </p>
            <p id="understandable-ex"><mark>Clear Language:</mark> All language used must be to-the-point and easy for any user to understand. <br><br>
                <mark>Consistency:</mark> There must be consistency in all aspects of the site including the typefaces used, the navigation patterns, and the colours.
                <br><br> <mark>Error Messages:</mark> There must be clear instructions given to the user to assist with tasks, and there should also
                be proper error messaging to show the user where they have gone wrong. <br><br> <mark>Predictability: </mark> There should be predictable patterns to
                the interactivity of the site, this means that the user will have a more consistent experience overall.
            </p>
            <p id="robust"><b>Robust:</b> The site should be properly developed to be interpreted efficiently by many types of user agents, this includes assistive
                technologies. It must be compatible across all user agents, and must stay consistent through them all. Some key elements include:
            </p>
            <p id="robust-ex"><mark>Compatiblity:</mark> All content in the site must be compatible with all new and old versions assistive technologies. <br><br>
                <mark>Semantic HTML:</mark> Semantic HTML must be used to ensure that the site is well structured.
            </p>

            <h3 id="compliance-title">Compliance Level</h3>
            <p id="compliance">In the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, there are three levels of compliance: A (lowest), AA (middle), and AAA (highest).
                These are based on how accessible the website is.
            </p>
            <p id="levels"><mark>Level A (Minimum):</mark> This is given when the site reaches the basic requirements for accessibility. All sites should have at least
                this level of compliance for accessibility. <br><br> <mark>Level AA (Mid-Level):</mark> This is given when the site has a higher level of accessibility. These are considered to be
                decently accessible and will give a better experience to those using the site. Often it includes better navigation, better contrast, and it is compatible with
                assistive technologies. <br><br> <mark>Level AAA (Highest):</mark> This is given when the site is at the highest possible level of accessibility. A site with this level will
                give the best possible experience to those who use assistive technologies, use other forms of navigation, etc. It will include all options of
                accessibility, with alt text in the site, captions on videos, strong contrast, and clear instructions/error messages.
