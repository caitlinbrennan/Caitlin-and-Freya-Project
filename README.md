This is our group project for Web User Interface Design. The project is focused on Web Content Accessiblity Guidelines, how to implement more accessibility into your websites, and what you can use to do this. 
We have decided to split the project into 2 halves, with Caitlin working on the homepage and the information page for Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines, while Freya is focusing on the information pages for semantic HTML and accessiblity. We also decided to split the documentation between us, we used a joint document to both have inputs.
